# Model building and tuning
> Here I will explain how to use **tuned** models to train and fit to evaluate their performance!

## General info

XGB_7_1: rmse=10.282 (108 files) with sample_weight=None, run in 850 seconds

XGB_7_1: rmse=10.184 (108 files) with sample_weight=sample_weight2, run 920 seconds

XGB_7:   rmse=  (108 files) with sample_weight=sample_weight2, run   seconds

So sample_weight2 DOES improve model performance by 0.1!!! This is with 'DEPTH' added as a feature.
